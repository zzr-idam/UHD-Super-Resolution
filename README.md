# UHD-Super-Resolution with mobileSAM
We create a dataset and a customized algorithm to run image super-resolution at 4K resolution in real time.
Notably, the feature maps obtained from the Segment Anything are fused with the original images and fed into the network.

# Dataset (Baidu cloud)


We used bilinear interpolation and JPEG compression (compression rate from random).

# Model 

We propose the U-AsConvSR algorithm based on the AsConvSR: Fast and Lightweight Super-Resolution Network with Assembled Convolutions at CVPR 2023.
